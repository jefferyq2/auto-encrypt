# Developer Documentation

This documentation includes the implementation details of Auto Encrypt and is intended to aid you if you’re trying to improve, debug, or get a deeper understanding of Auto Encrypt.

If you just want to use Auto Encrypt, please see the public API, as documented in the [README](readme.md).

The developer documentation is generated using [jsdoc-to-markdown](https://github.com/jsdoc2md/jsdoc-to-markdown) from the [developer-documentation.hbs](./developer-documentation.hbs) template.

The dependency diagram generation process as part of this requires [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/download) (`dot` command) to be installed. e.g., on Ubuntu:

```sh
sudo apt install graphviz
```

To update the documentation:

```sh
npm run generate-developer-documentation
```

## Requirements

Auto Encrypt is supported on:

  - __Node:__ LTS (currently 14.16.0).
  - __ECMAScript:__ [ES2019](https://node.green/#ES2019)

## Overview of relationships

![Dependency relationship diagram for Auto Correct](artefacts/dependency-graph.svg)

__Not shown (for clarity):__ third-party Node modules, the `util` namespace with helper modules – for logging, error handling, and an async `forEach` implementation – and the `typedefs` namespace with JSDoc type definitions.

Generated using [dependency cruiser](https://github.com/sverweij/dependency-cruiser).

## Tests

Main test tasks use an automatically-managed local Pebble server instance with settings optimised for performance.

### Prerequisites

  1. Add `pebble` as an alias for `127.0.0.1` and `::1` in your _/etc/hosts_ file. If you’re running in a container (e.g., using DistroBox/podman on Fedora Silverblue, make sure you set this in the _etc/hosts_ file of the host system, not the container)) e.g.

     ```
     # Loopback entries; do not change.
     # For historical reasons, localhost precedes localhost.localdomain:
     127.0.0.1   localhost localhost.localdomain localhost4 localhost4.localdomain4 pebble
     ::1         localhost localhost.localdomain localhost6 localhost6.localdomain6 pebble
     ```

  2. __To run staging and production tests (you do not need to do this to run the Pebble tests):__ make sure that your system is reachable from your hostname (e.g., by using a service like ngrok.)

```sh
npm -s run test
```

Tests should also pass with Pebble’s default settings and with the Let’s Encrypt staging server. The full set of test tasks are:

| Name                                | Server  | Sleep? | Nonce reject? | Debug output? |
|-------------------------------------|---------|--------|---------------|---------------|
| test                                | Pebble  |   ✘    |       ✘       |       ✘       |
| test-debug                          | Pebble  |   ✘    |       ✘       |       ✔       |
| test-pebble-sleep                   | Pebble  |   ✔    |       ✘       |       ✘       |
| test-pebble-sleep-debug             | Pebble  |   ✔    |       ✘       |       ✔       |
| test-pebble-sleep-noncereject       | Pebble  |   ✔    |       ✔       |       ✘       |
| test-pebble-sleep-noncereject-debug | Pebble  |   ✔    |       ✔       |       ✔       |
| test-staging                        | Staging |  n/a   |      n/a      |       ✘       |
| test-staging-debug                  | Staging |  n/a   |      n/a      |       ✔       |

## Coverage

There are several different code coverage tasks that correspond to the test tasks. Coverage task names begin with _coverage_ instead of _test_ and there are no debug versions for them.

```sh
npm -s run coverage
```

The full set of coverage tasks are:

| Name                                    | Server  | Sleep? | Nonce reject? |
|-----------------------------------------|---------|--------|---------------|
| coverage                                | Pebble  |   ✘    |       ✘       |
| coverage-pebble-sleep                   | Pebble  |   ✔    |       ✘       |
| coverage-pebble-sleep-noncereject       | Pebble  |   ✔    |       ✔       |
| coverage-staging                        | Staging |  n/a   |      n/a      |
