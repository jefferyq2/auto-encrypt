// Nonce
//
// In order to protect ACME resources from any possible replay attacks,
// ACME POST requests have a mandatory anti-replay mechanism.  This
// mechanism is based on the server maintaining a list of nonces that it
// has issued, and requiring any signed request from the client to carry
// such a nonce. – RFC 8555 § 6.5
//
// Before sending a POST request to the server, an ACME client needs to
// have a fresh anti-replay nonce to put in the "nonce" header of the
// JWS.  In most cases, the client will have gotten a nonce from a
// previous request.  However, the client might sometimes need to get a
// new nonce, e.g., on its first request to the server or if an existing
// nonce is no longer valid. – RFC 8555 § 7.2
